This module provides kinematics support. These are typically accessed through the environment classes. See
 `tesseract_kinematics_example.py` for examples of using forward and inverse kinematics. The kinematics
 functionality is provided using plugins, that must be configured by yaml files. See the documentation for the main
 Tesseract package for more details on configuring plugins.
 See the example for more information.
