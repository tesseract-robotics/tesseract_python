# Example of using kinematics to solve for forward and inverse kinematics. A tesseract environment is created
# using URDF and SRDF files. The kinematics solver is configured using the SRDF file and plugin configuration files.

# Initialize Environment with a robot from URDF file
# The URDF and SRDF file must be configured. The kinematics solver also requires plugin configuration,
# which is specified in the SRDF file. For this example, the plugin configuration file is `abb_irb2400_plugins.yaml`
# and is located in the same directory as the SRDF file. This example uses the OPW kinematics solver, which is
# a solver for industrial 6-dof robots with spherical wrists. The kinematic parameters for the robot must
# be specified in the plugin configuration file in addition to the URDF file for the plugin to work.
# The other main solver is the KDL solver, which is used by the lbr_iiwa_14_r820 robot also included in the
# tesseract_support package. The KDL solver is a numerical solver and does not require additional configuration.

# This example uses the GeneralResourceLocator to find resources on the file system. The GeneralResourceLocator
# uses the TESSERACT_RESOURCE_PATH environmental variable.
#
# TESSERACT_RESOURCE_PATH must be set to the directory containing the `tesseract_support` package. This can be done
# by running:
#
# git clone https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/tesseract.git
# export TESSERACT_RESOURCE_PATH="$(pwd)/tesseract/"
#
# or on Windows
#
# git clone https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/tesseract.git
# set TESSERACT_RESOURCE_PATH=%cd%\tesseract\
